# Recovering data from a bricked Raspberry Pi CM4

I like the CM4, but it's pretty easy to blow them up. The PMIC doesn't have any kind of short circuit protection, so if you short any rail to ground, or any pin driven high, it will die. Replacement PMIC's are *almost* available, but not quite. Earlier versions of the chip are on sale from Mouser, etc., but not the P4 revision that's on the Pi 4 / CM4. 

I've blown up three of them so far by doing various stupid things. They're not expensive, but if you've got some critical data stored on one and it ain't backed up properly - expect trouble.
